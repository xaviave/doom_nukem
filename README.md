# Doom_nukem

## Introduction

> Doom Nukem is a game created by @mel-akio and me (@xamartin) who is an Doom and Duke Nukem inspired.
We've recreate our own 3D engine ( jk ) who use the raycasting tech like the one of Duke Nukem. 

## Code Samples

>  Our map generator is simple to use and do everything you want but if you really want to do your own map from scratch, here a diy to do this map                            
 (https://github.com/xaviave/doom_nukem/blob/master/data/test.dk) :

create all your point one by one on a paper an numbered them from the left to the right and from the top to the bottom (0 for the empty space)  :

1-----2-----3   
|0000|0000|   
4-----5-----6   
|0000|0000|      
7-----8-----9  

Then when you got this create your line which begin with a 'v' for vertex, the point Y axe for all the points then reference the x follow by a semi-colon ';' an the id of the point like this : 

v 0 0;1 5;2 10;3   
v 5 0;4 5;5 10;6    
v 10 0;7 5;8 10;9

for the linedef, define the linedef's id, then define it with the 2 points' ids who are on the side of the linedef and then the sprite define by the id of the sprite. The first char is 'l'.  (0 define transparent wall wich could be cross):

l for linedef   1 for the lindef's id    1 & 2 for the vertex's id and 12 for the texture's id
l 1 1 2 12   
...   
l 5 2 5  0   
...    
l  8 9 1 4;19

 then for the sector, put a 's' at the beginning, the id of the sector, the height of the floor and the ceiling and the list of the linedef's id who define the sector (every linedef HAVE to have a common vertex, it means that every vertex must touch the next vertex), so :

s 1 0 20 1 2 3 4 6 .    
...    
s  4 10 25 7 9 10 12

ENJOY ! (the map is false and i don't care go see map.dk for a fully functionnal map)

## Installation

> To play the game, test the engine or just create a map, clone the repo then make and tap ./doom_nukem for the game, ./engine and ./map_generator
